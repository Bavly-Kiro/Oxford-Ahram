this project was for a courses center to develop a website that allowed them to make course videos available online for their students during the COVID-19 pandemic. I was responsible for designing and implementing the system architecture, as well as the front-end and back-end development.

To ensure secure access to the videos, I developed a system that used specific codes to allow only students who paid for a course to access its videos. Additionally, I used PHP and jQuery to create a "chunking" system that divided large video sessions into smaller parts, making it easier to upload and stream the videos.

To allow center administrators and teachers to modify the curriculums and upload videos to the students, I created a dashboard with different roles and permissions. This allowed them to fully customize the courses and provide the best learning experience for their students.

Throughout the project, I gained valuable experience in front-end and back-end development, database management, and security protocols. I also improved my skills in project management, communication, and problem-solving.
